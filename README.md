# music-player-app
This is a mock project i made in a team of 4 when i was trainee in FPT Software. My part is getting music file from external storage. The rests are my teammates's work. We are still trainee so the app can't be perfect.
This is also the first project i upload on github because i am new to github, so if there is any problem please let me know. Thanks in advance.
